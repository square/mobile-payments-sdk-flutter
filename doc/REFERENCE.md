# Flutter Mobile Payments SDK Technical Reference

In this reference, you'll find detailed information about the data types and methods available in the Flutter plug-in. As an overview, the plug-in is structured as follows:
* `square_mobile_payments_sdk`: This file acts as an abstraction layer that exposes key functionality of the Square Mobile Payments SDK in Flutter. It serves as the primary entry point for interacting with the underlying platform, encapsulating methods related to: Authentication, SDK State, Configuration & Status, MockReader UI, Settings UI, Payment Processing.
* `src`: Includes the enum definitions, errors, and the objects used in the plug-in. For errors, this serves as a reference for all the possible errors some methods might return.

## Methods
### Authorization

The Authorization methods handles authorizing and deauthorizing your application to process payments on behalf of a Square seller using an [OAuth access token](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/what-it-does) and a [location ID](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/locations-api)
. OAuth access tokens are used to get authenticated and scoped access to any Square account. These tokens should be used even if you only plan to use the Mobile Payments SDK with your own Square account. For more information, see [OAuth sample applications](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sample-apps#oauth-samples).


Method                                                    | Returns                       | Description
--------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---
[authorize](#authorize) | String | Authorizes the SDK to take payments given an access token and a location ID.
[deauthorize](#deauthorize) | String | Deauthorizes the SDK
[getAuthorizedLocation](#getauthorizedlocation) | [Location](#location) | Gets the currently authorized location.
[getAuthorizationState](#getauthorizationstate) | [AuthorizationState](#authorizationstate) | Returns the current authorization state AuthorizationState.

#### Method details

#### Method details
##### startPayment

Starts a payment taking payment and prompt parameters, and returns a Payment object, or an error including a PaymentError. The payment parameters will include things like the amount, application fees; prompt parameters will include the accepted payment methods, and the mode (which, for now, only covers the default mode). Default prompt mode takes over the entire screen, and handles all the payment interactions.

For details on the parameters, visit the respective PaymentParameters and PromptParameters sections.

Parameter | Type   | Description
--------- | ------ | -----------
paymentParameters | [PaymentParameters](#paymentparameters) | Parameters to configure the payment.

### Reader

The Reader methods allows you to toggle mock readers, which simulate taking payments while in Sandbox mode.

Method                                                    | Returns                       | Description
--------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---
[showMockReaderUI](#showmockreaderui) | void | Shows the mock reader UI, which allows to connect mock readers and simulate card interactions.
[hideMockReaderUI](#hidemockreaderui) | void | Hides the mock reader UI.


### TapToPaySettings

The `TapToPaySettings` provides methods specifically for managing Tap to Pay functionality on iOS devices.

Method                                                    | Returns                       | Description

[isDeviceCapable](#isDeviceCapable) | Promise<Boolean> | Checks if the current device is capable of using Tap to Pay (iOS only).



#### Method details

##### showMockReaderUI

When the SDK is started in Sandbox mode (this means, a Sandbox Application ID is given to initialize the SDK, as well as an access token and location that exist in Sandbox), it is possible to simulate payments with mock readers. These readers do not take real money, and allow to simulate card success and failures. The Mock Reader UI is displayed on top of the existing view, and persist through different views until dismissed. To access all the different actions available, tap on the mock reader UI.

* **On success**: shows the mock reader UI.
* **On failure**: throws an error detailing reasons why showing a mock reader isn't possible. Reasons might include: not in sandbox environment, mock reader already presented.

---

##### hideMockReaderUI

Dismisses the mock reader.

* **On success**: dismisses the mock reader UI.
* **On failure**: throws an error if the reader can't be dismissed, for instance, if it's not presented.
